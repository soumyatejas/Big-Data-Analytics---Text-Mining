Henry Kendall's It! to 0 viciorv over
the I'niversity of liklalioma was the
chief tuple of conversation today m
southwestern football circles. It was
the first defeat for the Sooners in two
'years, an event of prime Importance In
; southwestern conference circles.
Ithoueh tho ilefeat yesterday did not

In seeing It in anything portentous
regarding future games.
The I sual Alibi.
Minus tho services of several play
ers, tho Sooners admittedly were not
at their best. There was no attempt,
however, to belittle Kendall's aggres
sive victory, which was presaged last
year when they held Oklahoma to a
one point victory.
Arkansas continued to show a scor
ing power, which stamps thein as a
dangerous contender for conference
honors. Against tho Oklahoma School
of Mines, the Hazorbarks Saturday
made 8 points while holding the visi
tors scoreless. In three games Arkan
sas has stored 174 points.

It is not legally compulsory but tiny
proceed to state that they are In
formed that then- Is to bo a perma
nent organization "of force through
out the country." This permanent or
ganisation is to keep tabs un the fed
eral officeholders. A record Is to be
made "of the loyalty" of those ap
pointees who rontriliute, and of the
"disloyally" of those federal offieo
holderH who derline to rnntrihuto to
tho WHson campaign fund. This mere
ly notified federal officeholders, on
the authority of tho national Demo
cratic executive committee, that If
they do not "contribute" 10 per cent
of a year's salary to th Wilson cam
paign fund they will be marked down
by the Wilson permanent organization
as disloyal.
Tho Instructions to tho strong-arm
squad go ahead to point out that It Is
a violation of the civil service law tn
write a letter to a postmaster demand
ing money for campaign purposes or
to rail upon the postmasters In the
pestoffice and asl: for a subscription
to the ranuiaign fund. The strongarni
squad Is directed, therefore, to avoid
writing to federal authorttls or lull
ing upon them In their offices, but Is
advised to wok private appointments
with the federal off leehohhvs; to find
them at their homes or to catch them
when they are temporarily off the Job.
To Keep Out of Prison.
With this explanation rif the legal
difficulties In their way. the strnnu
arni squar Is admonished . ot "pro
ceed intelligently along those lines"
nnd to contrive "In a legal way" to so
licit the federnl officeholders.
There are several sections of the
federal statutes, the spirit of which, If
not the letter, is clearly violated bv
the procedure planned under the aus
pices of the national Demacrillc exe
cutive pommlttee.
Sortlon 11R of the T'nltod States
criminal code, which embodies Section
11 of the civil service act, deals with
one phase of this matter.
Section 119 of the I'nltod States
criminal codo, whb h embodies Section
12 of the civil service act. deals with
nnother phase of it. It is this latter
section to which the fr. liners of the
Democratic extortion scheme specific
ally lefer in their Instructions to the
stiongarm sound.
Sections 120 and 121 of the Fnlted
States criminal code, which embody
sections IS and 14 of the civil service
net. refer to other phases of the
matter.
It Is obvious thnt the men who de
veloped tho scheme for tho national
Democratic executive committee, and
who nre endeavoring to operate It, had
those provisions of the law In mind,
and have sought deliberately to find
the technical loophole which will en
able them to contravene the spirit and
tho purpose of the statute and yet
escape the punishment of a $5,000 fine
or Imprisonment for three years or
both.
M Cormick "Smiflslics".
Vance McCormick, chairman of the
Democratic national committee, yes
terday virtuously denied the charge
that the Democratic organization was
attempting to extort campaign funds
from postmasters and other federal
officials by a 10 per rent political as
sessment. Today he admits the charge
but tries to explain It. Tomorrow he
may have to explain his explanation,
In view of further conclusive and con
firmatory evidence which haa reached
the Itopiiblican national committee.
When Mr. MoOormlok's attention
was directed to the charge that the
Democratic cnmpalgn committee,
through H. Honna Hldgway, a mem
ber of the Democratic national finance
committee and chairman of the Demo
cratic central committee of Texas, win
uttemptlngto hold up the postmasters
of the country by collecting "contribu
tions" of 10 per cent of their annual
salaries under the threat that a record
would be kept of those who proved
"loyal" by contributing and of thoHO
who proved "disloyal" by refusing 10
contribute, Chairman McCormick said:
"These charges tiro the most nrrnnt
nonsense nnd aro absolutely untruo.
They nre In line with tho campaign of
misrepresentation thnt tho Kepub
llcans hnvc been making from the
start."

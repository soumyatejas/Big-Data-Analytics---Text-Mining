( I NNING OLD bird will UT
TER a LOCI) SCREAM nn.l
Make for tho hawk. The hawk
drops his FISH and the oaj;lo
CATCHES the FISH before it
STRIKES tho WATER. It was
not the HAWK that tho EAGLE
WANTED but he WANTED the
FISH.
If a POOR UNFORTUNATE
pirl is FORCED to LIVE in the
UEDLIGHT and if she makes a
dollar a BIG COP gets the dol
lar before tho poor UNFOR
TUNATE GIRL can pay it on a
pair of SHOES. The poor pirl
,'poes back to make another dollar.

ney, and Glenn Condon, ono of tho
two nominees of his party for tho
legislature.
Thr addresses were listened to
with great Interest and npplauso was
freiiient. After the meeting scores of
men pledged to the two candidates
their support and predicted that they
would receive a majoiity of tho votes
In the elty on November 7.
Onc-lourth of all the li gul voters In
Broken, Allow altended tho meeting,
which was jai tlrularly slKtilflccnt for
the reason that they were nbout
eiinatly illvlded as between Republi
cans and Democrats. Many farmers
from out In the country attended.
M. A. Hovser presided.
Standing on Merit.
Mr. Baldwin made a clear, straight
for ward talk In which ho outlined the
principles on which he Is runnhiK,
"1 havo no attack to make on my
opponent," ho said. "1 am running
on my own merits. I hnve made no
alignments. I am spending my own
money und am making no wild prom
ises to any faction or Individual. I
nay to you that If I nm elected I will
give all my tlmo to the office. I will
endeavor to do my share toward re
ducing tho taxes by insisting on
prompt nnd speedy trials of all crimi
nal cases. I shall see that no man Is
dotulned long In jail without a luar
ln . 1 shall Investigate every com
plaint thoroughly M-foro Issuing a
warrant. I will enforce all the laws
without fear or favor and tho matter
of politics will never enter Into tho
conduct of my office."
Tho chairman then Introduced T. 1.
tlannefin, for years u prominent
Democrat here, and Mr. Hennefln in
turn presented Condon to the assem
blage. "1 would not be doing my duty as
a former newsboy," he said, "If 1 did
not rise on this occasion, forgot my
politics for the time being and Intro
duce another man who started In life
as a newsboy anil who has risen to his
present high position in the profession
throiiKh sheer merit ami without the
advantages of a college education."
In spite of the fact that he was in
the home town of one of his oppo
nents who was present, Condon stated
lit the outset of his remarks thai he
did not propose to "slim,' mud" ami
that lie had the highest respect tor
his distinguished opponents.
Two Many l.u.
He recited his experience in the
legislature two years ami as a reporter
and declared that his platform,
broadly speaking, was to repeal many
of the useless and conflicting laws noiv
on tho statute books and then in.' i.-t
on a speedy adjournment.
"Tins county needs adequate rcpic
sentatlon In the Icaislatere,' he
elated. "It needs men there who will
rise about politics and stand for legis
lation that will protect the oil Industry
nnd the people of the county and
against the legislation that. Is adverse
to these interests. 1 believe 1 know
what Tulsa county needs over then;
und I can do as much as any man
toward getting It."
Condon exploded the Democratic
theory that nuirh of the public (b-b! in
this Mate was willed to the Democratic
administration sinco statehood by the
last Republican administration before
statr hood.
lie cited figures to show that the
territorial administration turned over
to the first state administration the
sum of ,171.3ti4.3.ri and that tho out -standing
warn-nts at that tlmo totaled
$"74. 071. SI, leaving a cash surplus on
hand of $2:t7,2H2.44.
"The present unpaid debts nnd nil
of the expenditures since statehood,"
lie said, "could not have been in
curred by other than Democrats. The
expense of government In this state Is
fur too high and entirely out of pro
portion to the expenditures In other
states In the union."
He showed that the expenses of tho
legislative sessions held since stale
hood have amounted to a prand total
of more than $ 1 ."00, 010. He pointed
out that tho five state legislatures havo
appropriated, to pny the expense of
state government, a total of more than
$40,000,000.
lltist the Macliino.
"What we need Is fewer offices,
fewer salaries, fewer appropriations,
and the elimination of machine poli
tics and tho extravagance that poos
with It," ho said.
Ho scored Campbell RuSsell In
straight terms nnd declared that Tu'sa
county had always gotten the worst
of It from the legislature, for the
renson that It was largely mado up of
men like Russell, who seemed to think
that half of tho revenue of the state
should come from Tulsa county.

The audience, for the most part, was
disappointed. .Many did not even

There was nothing unusual about
Harrison's: address. It was the old

publican and unbridled laudation of

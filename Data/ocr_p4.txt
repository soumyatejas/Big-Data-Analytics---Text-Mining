LJr- awiy,.n.t solitude,
waxed and waned
redemption has reached a climax so surprising, so startling, and yet so won
derful u.s In send 1 thrill to the heart. Mod has again revealed himself to
Ins children, but Instead of the at eiiinpanlinrnls of overwhelming splendor
that flashed fi Min SH.ai, he tomes now in humble guise a (lalilean
vvoikinaii on an eriand ,- human .service In one .scene, was the revealing or
Mie law, and the iitlni the revealing of the life. For the man ot Malilee hail
conic to be the tuililltng ol the law. to show lis Hue nuliire to us, to s rip
away the misconceptions ol the centuries, tho wrath and the terror, and lo
show that ils true nature was the teiiiieiTSt love.
It Is Mie ten.leiicv ol model n religion to greatly mini mine if it does not
wholly nl. rugate Hie 1 lenient ol Mie tear of (iod. According to somi: ol the
newest philosophies Mule is 110 sinii thing as evil, and no such thing as
wrath, 1 se,,ucntly no occasion for tear. The thunders and threalenings of
Sinai were the misconceptions of piimitlvu stages of spiritual uninlelllgvnco
and bcnightedness. .
Hut we caniiol abrngali; the terrible fact nr evil, nor the black cloud ful
minaling wrath ami punishment, civciiianglng the violated law. All Mint wo
can .succeed In doing is lo contuse, and linully lo destroy our power to prop
erly distinguish between the good and evil. 11 we say there Is mi evil and no
Mod prescribing the good and warning against the bad, the latter does not
thcrebv cease In exist. Wr merely at III 111 that evil is not ev il ami enthrone
our own unregulated appetite as the final arbiter of what wo shall regard as
gimd.
Tho human mind let me say Just here in passing has no power to de
termine Mio absolute character ot anything. Our Judgments are merely rela
tive. We ran knmv light only by Ils conmist with darkness. We ean know
good only as set over against that which men have come to recognize as evil.
And thu recognition of this by humanity has been throughout its history al
ways connected With thu 1. bscrval.de penalties uttaching to tho violations, of
law. The law nf God Is the law of love when operating 1" it" normal chan
nels, but It becomes a factor of destruction in tho lllo of those who disobey.
As tho electric fluid, though a beneficent thing in Itself, becomes a disruptive
vloleiico when Ils current Is obstructed, or as the life-giving heat ot the
sun Is turned into decay when It flows Into dead organic matter on tho
ground.
In tho city of Ii'cnver there lives a Judgo who attained to national distinc
tion by reason of his wonderful success in dealing with youthful criminals.
And that siicccs.-! was dim In an unusual degree to the quality we call love
In his heart. Hoys ot various ages, caught in all kinds of law-breaking, were
brought before him, and instead of thundering sentences at them from tho
bench and sending them to Jail he sat down on the seat beside them and
talked to them llko a father, In earnest appeals to their better natures. Tho
method was successful In redeeming a large number nl nmlolactors from
their evil ways wh , bad they been sent to Jail, would ill all probability have
been confirmed in a life nf crime.
Hut what was the explanation of this extraordinary influence? You and
I could not have effected It. Tho Judge could not, in un official capacity.
His benevolent control ovei those boys was due lo a combination of his
philanthropy- ami his Juilgship. They knew that back of the love nnd pardon
there loomed the power and the will to punish If they were impenitent. They
responded to the Human friendship and sympathy of the man because back
nf him there stood forth li. their imagination the awful majesty and threat
ening arm of the law.
To the end Mint we may come to know the majesty nf tho divine law,
tho penalties attaching to lis violation, and to have the faith and thestrength
to walk patiently 111 the wav of Its obedience, wc should not attempt to
dissipate the element ol leal in religion on the ground that It implies a de
rogatory estimate of Mod. ll does not do that, for fear Is needed as the back
ground to the deepest religious experience. We cannot rightly estimate the
brightness and glory of the .Mount of Transfiguration except as It stands out
against Hie dark background of Sinai. The fear, however, will duly ripen
Into love, and the love will be all the more constant because II began in fear.
The gentleness, the sympathy and the love of Jesus of Nazareth can lie rightly
measure, I only as we see that behind Hie lowly demeanor there towers the
overwhelming- might nnd majesty of tho (Indhead.
Thus In the combination ot the two Ideas, and not In either by Itself, we
have the complete nnd highest connection of the deity. The noblest dignity
of tho soul Is In reverence. The tempest blast, the destroying flood, the sky
reverberating thunder were intended to Inspire that sense of the aw ful power
or tho Creator before which the soul cringes. And no one who has none of
this holy fear In him cui truly appreciate the majesty of these things. A
soul without fear is a soul without sublimity. To rob religion of Its fear is to
enfeeble, to belittle, to emasculate It.
That we may come to understand Ond as indeed a being of undiluted
lovo who punishes no one the only punishment for sin being the injury
wrought upon our own characters let us, with our backs turned upon
Pinal, set our faces toward the Mount of Transfiguration. Ho has "bowed
the heavens and come down," Immanuel. find with us. Ho has cloaked him
self In our Infirm humanity, has immersed himself In all tho woes and all
the evils of our sufforlnc flesh. Ho Is now to show that back of nnd within
that lowly exterior Is the glory of tho fullness of tho (indhead, nnd a new
version of the old scene nn Si nut Is to be enacted. In the plnce of the great
multitude there nro now but threo fishermen, but these go up with the Lord
Into tho mountain. As ol old. .Moses is present emerging trom the mystery
of tho spirit world to lend Ills authority to tho scone and, as of old, tho
cloud hangs over tho mountain. But It Is now transparent, luminous. In
stead of tho black pall of smoke that went up from Slanl, flssurod by hidden
flaino, tho mountain Is bathed In light. "For, lo tho fare of tho man of sor
rows did shine ns tho sun and his raiment was white as light."
Thus we come to know Mod as he Is In his Inmost essence. And, as, step
by step, we desist from tho evil wo come Into the region of the eternally real.
Into tho presence of a divine being whoso wrath Is but an appearance, ex
isting for us only In the 1 palms of violated law. A (Sod of tho most chango
b ss pity, ever seeking the elevation of tho most fallen of his children, al
ways hungering to fold them forever to his breast of love.
